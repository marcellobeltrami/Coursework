# Coursework
Coursework code and data used in my Msc Bioinformatics.

### Statistics
Markov chain modelling of diseases: used a 4 state markov chain to model survival to disease for an X amount of patients. 
Differential gene expression analysis: coded from scratch the statical side differential gene expression such as GLM, PCA, and Heatmap gene expression.  

### Machine learning
Analysis focusing on using clinical patient data to a   explore data patterns within lifestyles and train a model to predict whether the patient is likely to predict a metabolic diseases.
  ---> Data pre-processing and linear regression used for data imputation. Class imbalance was dealt with using imbalanced learning. 
  ---> Unsupervised learning: spot data patterns. Algorithms used include tSNE and UMAP used for non-linear dimensionality reduction. Clustering was carried out using K-Means algorithm.
  ---> Supervised learning: Teste Random Forest (RF), SVM, Logistic Regression and decision tree. Best performing algorithms was Random Forest.
